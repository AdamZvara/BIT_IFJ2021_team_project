For scanner testing:
    Create your-test.input, your-test.expected in scanner-tests dir,
    then run ./runtests.sh

    .expected file should be in this format:
        for tokens without any special values:
            `type_of_token` (e.g. `TOK_LES_EQ`)
        for tokens that carry additional info:
            `type_of_token : value` (e.g. `TOK_INT : 50`)

    compilation of scanner-helper is needed and mentioned in scanner-helper.c
