For scanner testing:
    Create your-test.input, your-test.expected in scanner-tests dir,
    then run ./runtests.sh

    .expected file should be in this format:
        for tokens without any special values:
            `type_of_token` (e.g. `TOK_LES_EQ`)
        for tokens that carry additional info:
            `type_of_token : value` (e.g. `TOK_INT : 50`)
        end each file with newline

    compilation of scanner-helper is needed and mentioned in scanner-helper.c
    do not start .input file with error token!
    
For parser testing:
    normal, simple folder:
        Create your-test.input, your-test.expected
        run ./parser_tests.sh

        .expected file should contain output of program
    error:
        Name of file ending with error code of compilator
